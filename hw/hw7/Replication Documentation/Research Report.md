## Hypothesis
Movies directed by women receive lower ratings than movies directed by men. 

## Results
Data from 1000 movies were downloaded. 136 of these had the director listed as "N/A" and were filtered out, leaving 864. The gender of the director of 718 of these could be unambiguously determined using the "gender" package. Genders were indeterminate for an additional 146 of these, which were removed from the analysis in keeping with the analysis plan (see the appendix for results including those movies). 

In the per movie analysis, there were 718 movies, 47 of which were by female gendered directors (6.5%). The mean (SD) rating of movies directed by women was 6.72 (1.14) as compared to 6.56 (1.19) for men. This gives an Cohen's d for effect size of -0.14 for men minus women (p = 0.830, Welch Two Sample t-test for men being rated higher than women). 

In the per director analysis, there were 639 directors, 45 of whom were female gendered (7.0%). The mean (SD) rating of movies directed by women was 6.72 (1.15) as compared to 6.53 (1.19) for men. This gives an Cohen's d for effect size of -0.16 for men minus women (p = 0.856, Welch Two Sample t-test for men being rated higher than women). 

This shows that there is minimal difference between the ratings received for movies directed by men or women.

## Conclusion
Movies directed by women are not rated lower than movies directed by men. 

## Appendix: Results with no manual gender coding
As described above, director genders were indeterminate for 146 movies and these movies were removed. In the analysis plan, indeterminate genders were to be determined manually if there were fewer than 50 or those movies were to be removed if there were more than 50 for feasibility reasons. It turned out to be quite quick and easy to look up the genders, so I looked them all up and was able to assign a gender for 138 of them. 

The same analysis as above is repeated here for the data *including* the movies where the gender of the directors was initially indeterminate. This analysis should be regarded as exploratory because it deviates from the analysis plan. The results, however, are quite similar to the results of the analysis above.

In the per movie analysis, there were 856 movies, 60 of which were by female gendered directors (7.5%). The mean (SD) rating of movies directed by women was 6.70 (1.24) as compared to 6.59 (1.18) for men. This gives an Cohen's d for effect size of -0.09 for men minus women (p = 0.744, Welch Two Sample t-test for men being rated higher than women). 

In the per director analysis, there were 760 directors, 58 of whom were female gendered (7.6%). The mean (SD) rating of movies directed by women was 6.70 (1.25) as compared to 6.56 (1.18) for men. This gives an Cohen's d for effect size of -0.12 for men minus women (p = 0.789, Welch Two Sample t-test for men being rated higher than women). 

This shows that there is minimal difference between the ratings received for movies directed by men or women.
